On my journey to become an at least half-decent front-end developer, I decided to start 2021 with a fun way to practice HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. This is an on-going project, but here's the [link](https://gunkarlsson.github.io/50daysofcode/) to the work in progress. 


It's based on the iconic duo [Brad Traversy](https://www.udemy.com/user/brad-traversy/) and [Florin Pop](https://www.udemy.com/user/popflorin/)'s course. A genuine thanks to them for putting together a brilliant challenge.
